# Security Rules

> IMPORTANT: These rules are MANDATORY. They apply to ALL interactions, ALL
> projects, ALL code.

## Secrets & Credentials

- NEVER include API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings, or certificates
  in code, comments, prompts, commit messages, or plan files — use placeholder
  descriptions (e.g., "Admin token from env") instead of actual values.
- NEVER hardcode credentials — use environment variables, secret vaults, or
  configuration references.
- Flag any file that matches secret patterns: `.env`, `credentials.json`,
  `*_key.*`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `secrets.*`, `*token*`.
- Before committing: warn if any staged file may contain secrets.
- If you accidentally see a secret in code, immediately flag it and recommend
  rotation.

## Code Security

- Flag security-sensitive changes: authentication flows, cryptographic
  operations, network calls, database queries, file system access,
  permission/role changes.
- Call out OWASP Top 10 risks when spotted — especially injection, broken auth,
  sensitive data exposure, and security misconfiguration.
- NEVER introduce `eval()`, `exec()`, `Function()`, dynamic SQL, or shell
  injection vectors without explicit user approval.
- Sanitize all user inputs at system boundaries — never trust external data.
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations.
- Prefer allowlists over denylists for input validation.

## Data Privacy

- NEVER include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive
  personal data in code, logs, comments, AI prompts, or plan files.
- Flag code that logs, stores, or transmits user data without explicit consent
  mechanisms.
- Warn when error messages or stack traces might expose sensitive information.
- Recommend data minimization — only collect and process what's necessary.
